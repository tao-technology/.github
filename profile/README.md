# Hi there 👋

The company Tao was founded in June 2022 by three young guys, we aimed to create artificial intelligence and its modules that are as close as possible to human intelligence and its level of understanding. We have combined data science, informatics, cyber security and artificial intelligence. In the future, we plan to create smart homes that will be equipped with Tao artificial intelligence, as well as a firewall for web applications based on machine learning, and develop the cyber sphere in Georgia.
